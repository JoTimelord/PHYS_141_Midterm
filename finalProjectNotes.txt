Instead of an elliptical orbit, the trajectory will follow a parabolic orbit, I think it is obtained be setting e = 1;
Initial conditions are described in the collision orbit note. There will be different conditions but should follow a similar code;
Wa and Wb are not identical antymore; ia and ib are also different;
